### About Me (detailed)
I am currently a Principal Video Systems Engineer, Research at Brightcove Inc. Previously I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Applied Computer Science at Kingston University London, United Kingdom where I primarily taught Data Science related subjects to Masters and UG final year students. I obtained my PhD in 2019 from Kingston University as part of MSCA ITN QoE-Net after which I worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Wireless Multimedia and Networking Research Group (WMN) at Kingston University. To learn further and improve business and managerial skills, along with my PhD, I completed MBA at Kingston Business School, London, in 2019, with the future aim of being a technological leader in the field of multimedia streaming. Before this, I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics Engineering in 2011 from the National Institute of Technology, Surat, India, and my Masters in Information Technology, specializing in Communication Engineering and Media Technology from UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, Germany in 2014. I also worked at Bell Labs, Stuttgart, Germany as part of my internship and Master thesis. 

I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) and also hold a position of Adjunct Lecturer in Applied Computer Science at Kingston University. A board member of the Video Quality Expert Group (VQEG), I am also involved in other standardization activities such as MPEG, JVET, SVA, CTA and DASH-IF. My research interests include multimedia streaming and data science.
