### About Me (detailed)

I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Applied Computer Science at Kingston University London, United Kingdom. I primarily teach Data Science related subjects to Masters and UG final year students and Algorithms and Data Structures to first year UG. I obtained my PhD in 2019 from Kingston University as part of MSCA ITN QoE-Net after which I worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Wireless Multimedia and Networking Research Group (WMN) at Kingston University. To learn further and improve business and managerial skills, along with my PhD, I completed an Executive MBA at Kingston Business School, London, in 2019, with the future aim of being a technological leader in the field of multimedia streaming. Before this, I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics Engineering in 2011 from National Institute of Technology, Surat, India, and Masters in Information Technology, specializing in Communication Engineering and Media Technology from UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, Germany in 2014. I worked at Bell Labs, Stuttgart, Germany, for 15 months as part of my internship and Master thesis.

I am currently a board member of Video Quality Expert Group (VQEG) as a part of the Computer Graphics Imagery (CGI) project and am also involved in ITU-T standardization activities. My research interests include multimedia communications, machine learning, data science and more recently distributed ledger technologies and TEM (Technology and Engineering Management). My academic qualifications and work experience in different roles have made me well-versed in a wide array of domains like wireless networks, computer science, and management.
